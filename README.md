# Startup_quotes

<br />

Echo a random inspirational quote `(like: "Never code in Haskell")` every time a new terminal is opened. <br />
The quotes file is customisable and you can add whatever you want!

<br />
<br />

<h6>
(Note: quotes.txt and ~/.zshrc must both be in the $HOME directory. If quotes isnt, change `local quotes_file="$HOME/quotes.txt"` <br />
to the path of your quotes file.)
